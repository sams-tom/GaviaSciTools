Creating a virtual environment using [this help](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-with-commands)

`conda create -n myenv python=3.8`



A collection of tools to process and analyse data from Teledyne Gavia Offshore Surveyor

I was having issues when developing the functions used to process that data. Running 

    python setup.py clean --all
    python setup.py develop
    
seemed to resolve the problem.
